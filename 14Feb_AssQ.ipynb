    "2. start : The \"start\" method is used to initiate the execution of a thread, causing it to begin executing its run method concurrently with other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. join : The \"join\" method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution before allowing the program to continue, effectively synchronizing the main thread with the specified thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. isAlive : The \"isAlive\" method is used to check whether a thread is currently active and executing its code. It returns True if the thread is alive and False otherwise."
