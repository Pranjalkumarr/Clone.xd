We can define an abstract class \"Shape\" that contains abstract methods like \"area\" and \"perimeter\" without providing specific implementations. Concrete subclasses like \"Circle,\" \"Rectangle,\" and \"Triangle\" will inherit from the abstract class and implement the \"area\" and \"perimeter\" methods according to their specific formulas. The details of how each shape calculates its area and perimeter are hidden, and we can treat all shapes uniformly using the common interface provided by the abstract class \"Shape.\""
